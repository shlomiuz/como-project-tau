    This function will take in the original user-item matrix and "mask" a percentage of the original ratings where a
    user-item interaction has taken place for use as a test set. The test set will contain all of the original ratings,
    while the training set replaces the specified percentage of them with a zero in the original ratings matrix.

    :param ratings: the original ratings matrix from which you want to generate a train/test set. Test is just a complete
    copy of the original set. This is in the form of a sparse csr_matrix.

    :param test_ratio: The percentage of user-item interactions where an interaction took place that you want to mask in the
    training set for later comparison to the test set, which contains all of the original ratings.

    :return:
    training_set - The altered version of the original data with a certain percentage of the user-item pairs
    that originally had interaction set back to zero.
    test_set - A copy of the original ratings matrix, unaltered, so it can be used to see how the rank order
    compares with the actual interactions.
    user_inds - From the randomly selected user-item indices, which user rows were altered in the training data.
    This will be necessary later when evaluating the performance via AUC.
